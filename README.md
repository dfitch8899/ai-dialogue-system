First add the AIDialogueCanvas, OptionsContainer, InteractText, and AIDialogueSystem prefabs to the hierarchy. **IMPORTANT: AIDialogueCanvas and OptionsContainer MUST BE CHILDREN OF A CANVAS GAME OBJECT** After that, add the AIDialogueUi script to AIDialogueCanvas. Then, add AIDialogueManager script to AIDialogueSystem. Now, go back to AIDialogueCanvas and add AiDialogueSystem under Ai Manager. Then, fill out Npc Name Text and Npc Text boxes with NPCNameText and NPCResponseText. Then, add the options container you added earlier to the options container section as well as the OptionButton under the Button Prefab section. Then, go to the NPC and add NPCDialogueTrigger script to it. After that, add AiDialogueCanvas under Dialogue UI. 

To edit the NPC's name and persona, click on the NPC and find the script with the text boxes for each of these. There is another box elsewhere with this information that is not of use, and can be ignored.

Note: You might want to edit prompting a bit, especially with more background info dependant on the module. The UI will also need edited (NPCBackground, NameText, ResponseText and OptionButton) as it will just be a white background until you do so. You can also add default dialogue options in AIDialogueCanvas. You also might have to unpack some things to modify read only scripts, as well as changing position of some things. For reference, see module 7 /main/Quest one changes branch and then talk to the construction worker NPC near spawn.
